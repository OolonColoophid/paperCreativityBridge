Dear [REDACTED],

Many thanks for getting back to us and for the time taken to request and collate these comments. The reviewers made some perceptive comments and we believe the final paper will make a useful contribution to the literature on boosting creativity through manipulating semantic networks.

With best wishes,

Ian Hocking and David Vernon

## Reviewer 1

1. Author(s) should make sure to follow APA formatting for in-text citations. On page 3, for example: (Newell, Simon, & others, 1972) should read (Newell, Simon, et al., 1972) or (Newell et al., 1972). The proper cite seems to be: (Newell & Simon, 1972). Therefore, “others” should be explicitly cited or removed. Similarly, on page 4, (H. A. Simon, 1973) should be (Simon, 1973).

- These errors were caused by metadata issues in a bibliographic manager. They have now been corrected.

2. Em dashes should be redone from --- to — (page 3)

- Corrected.

- We thank the reviewer for pointing out these interesting papers.

- Mednick's (1962) research has been introduced in the third paragraph as a more creativity-based conception of the Gardendors materials already presented. We have also included some of the findings of the above studies.

4. In the participants section, some justification is necessary for why there were more than double participants in the experimental group than the control group. This is relatively strange considering there seems to be no reasons why these groups couldn’t be closer to equal. Although the results can be adjusted for, there should be some reason for the disproportionate group sizes. Page 11 touches on this in the design section, however, the reasoning is still unclear. The author(s) could have ran 86 in the experimental condition and 85 in the control condition. Or, if as stated, ran 100 in the experimental condition and 71 in control condition to emphasize the experimental group. The substantial differences between group sizes weakens the study’s ability to detect all effect sizes.

- The justification for this is now presented in more detail in the Design and is now clearer in the Participants section. 

5. A few general questions about the methods: Were the participants instructed to “be creative” when coming up with responses? Or, were they instructed to “come up with as many ideas as they can?” Were they informed in any way that this was a creativity task? These instructions should be made more clear. It’s unclear if the participants even knew that they should try to be creative when coming up with solutions.

- We thank the reviewer for this comment. The Procedure section has been updated to be more specific, with written instructions included verbatim.

6. On page 12, “related tools” should be explicitly stated (e.g., specific R packages used).

- All *R* packages now have separate references.

7. The ICC type (Consistency or Absolute Agreement) should be stated.

- This (Absolute Agreement) is now clear in the MS.

8. On page 16, it’s discussed that a future version of the technique would benefit from deriving synonyms and antonyms from a free association task. I agree with this, however, latent semantic analysis (LSA; Landauer & Dumais, 1997) could also be useful. Although not perfect, LSA can provide semantic distances of synonyms and antonyms without having to collect more data to develop free association standards. Indeed, concepts wouldn’t need to be synonyms and antonyms, and instead could be concepts that are very nearly related and very remotely related.

- We thank the reviewer for this observation, and have included this in the Discussion.

9. In general, the manuscript would benefit from another round of proofreading for grammar and spelling errors.

- The MS has been proofread for grammar and spelling errors.


## Reviewer 2

1. Overall, the authors could make a stronger argument why their study is important throughout the introduction. The authors do not provide enough information related to WHY near and far conceptual cues may influence creativity. Some of my proceeding points give some suggestions for how the authors might better advocate the importance of their study.

- This has been addressed in incorporating Reviewer 1's comment 3. We have also added this statement to the end of the penultimate paragraph of the Introduction: 'Applying a systematic technique designed to expand the semantic network in a tested paradigm would be a useful starting point.'

2. In the first paragraph of page 3, the authors indicate that in CPS, ideas should be both original and creative. The authors should define these terms for the reader. Many researchers (e.g., Amabile, 1996; Reiter-Palmon, Mumford, & Threlfell, 1998) indicate that in order for ideas to be creative, they must be original and effective, feasible, or high quality. Using the word creative is redundant with Creative problem solving. The authors should revise this paragraph to reflect the more agreed upon definition of creativity which includes both elements of originality and quality or effectiveness. Further, they really should provide a brief definition of originality and effectiveness, feasibility, or quality.

- We thank the reviewer for this important clarification. We've now altered the end of the first paragraph to 'It is generally accepted that, within CPS, ideas should be both *novel* and *useful*'. The second paragraph then makes clear that we are defining these in terms of fluency, flexibility, originality and quality.

3.  There is a typo in the first paragraph of page 3 for the following text: “I need to be a good scientific paper'”. Perhaps the authors meant to say they need to write a good scientific paper rather than “be” a good scientific paper...

- This has been corrected.

4. The authors’ claim in the second paragraph on page 3 (“Given that every cultural and technological advance started with a creative idea, developing techniques to improve performance could have widespread benefit.”) should include citations.

- It's difficult to provide a citation for this. Any cultural or technological advance that did not begin with a creative idea would not, we argue, be an advance. To make sure that our intended meaning is clear, we've changed the statement to: 'Given, arguably, that every cultural and technological advance started with a creative idea, developing techniques to improve creative performance could have widespread benefit.'

5. The authors begin the first full paragraph on page 4 with “One candidate aspect of successful techniques is perspective-taking”, however, they should provide some clarity to help transition this sentence – i.e., successful techniques for increasing creative performance.

- We have changed this sentence to 'One candidate aspect of successful techniques underlying this creativity-boosting effect is perspective-taking.'

6. Typo page 4 – “where where.”
 
- This has been fixed.

7. The introduction of perspective-taking as one way that we might be able to expand someone’s conceptual space starts somewhat weakly. The authors use the example of Six Hats too early and rely on this example to define perspective-taking. Instead the authors change the order of sentences to first describe what perspective taking is and how it facilitates creativity. Then, the Six Hats technique can be used as an example to support this relationship. 

- We have edited the paragraph to make this clearer, as well as incorporating the comments below.

7a. Additionally, there is a vast amount of research on perspective-taking in teams that facilitates performance. The authors may benefit from briefly referring to this literature and then arguing how perspective-taking also facilitates individual performance as well. 

- We have added this to the above paragraph.

7b. Further, the authors should discuss early on what is meant by near and far cue distances and how they relate to creativity rather than waiting till later paragraphs to discuss (the authors define far cue distance on page 6 with “Some authors have argued that far analogies---i.e. those who surface features have little overlap with a given problem scenario---should help in the generations of novel concepts”). This is too late in the introduction to truly be useful, as readers will have had to generate their own idea of near and far distance. By defining near and far cues early on, this will better frame the rest of the introduction and set up the authors’ arguments.

- This is now defined in the third paragraph.

8. The following parentheses on page 5 (see, e.g., Daly, Christian, Yilmaz, Seifert, & Gonzalez, 2012) should be simplified to be (e.g., Daly, Christian, Yilmaz, Seifert, & Gonzalez, 2012).

- This has been done.

9. There is a spelling error for “antonym” as “antonymn” on page 5.

- This has been correct.

10. Typos on page 7: “widespread”, “design pat ents”, and “encouraged greater creativity and than 'far'…”.

- These have been corrected.

Methods:

11. The opportunity sample was made up of people who appeared to elect to attend a seminar on creative problem solving. In the discussion section, there should be consideration how this particular sample may be different than a typical sample as they appear to be people interested in the subject of creativity and were likely aware that the task was in regard to individual creativity. How might this have affected the results? Looking at table 3, it appears that each group had relatively high mean ratings of the importance of creativity.

- The reviewer writes, 'The opportunity sample was made up of people who appeared to elect to attend a seminar on creative problem solving.' Since this is not the case, the phrasing in the Participants section has been amended to reflect that the students were unaware of the topic prior to the informed consent stage. In previous studies of this nature, a high mean rating for the importance of creativity is common.

12. The authors mention in the Materials section that “To generate near and far conceptual cues for each problem, three problem stem concepts were identified that maximised, to the extent possible, coverage of the key elements in the problem scenario”. However, what was the process through which these were identified? Who identified them? How do we know these are valid conceptual cues? More information is necessary to determine how the use of these materials was piloted.

- We have made this clearer in the relevant section. The statements and their stems were very straightforward---e.g. for 'There are mice in my house', the stem concepts were 'are' (verb), 'mice' (noun) and 'house' (noun)---and agreed between the first and second authors. Note that these are not the cues themselves, but stems on which the cues were based.

13. I assume the booklet included all measures in the same order for all participants. As creative self-perception and importance measures were included first, might this have alerted participants to the nature of the study? How might this have influenced participant responses to the creative problem solving tasks? While the CPS tasks were counterbalanced, it is often good practice to counterbalance the order in which CPS and creative self-perception tasks appear. This ensures that people are not alerted to the nature of the task

- Where elements of the booklets were counterbalanced, these are made clear in the text. In reference to the comment, 'As creative self-perception and importance measures were included first, might this have alerted participants to the nature of the study?', we don't consider this a substantial issue because the nature of the study was clear to the participants throughout (i.e. that they were to use a technique to help them generate solutions). As such, questions such as 'How creative do you think you are?' should not reveal anything surprising to the participants.
 
14. Missing word (“is”) from following sentence “This design a little unorthodox…” on page 11 on Design section.

- This has been corrected.

Results:

14. Overall, the results section is concise and easy to follow. The authors could discuss the relatively high mean rating of how important participants perceived creativity to be. How might this have influenced the results? Referring to my earlier point about the opportunity sample being people who chose to attend a seminar on creative problem solving, these individuals already feel that creativity is something valuable, which may have influenced the results. The discussion section should address this by describing whether these findings might be consistent in other samples.

- To refer to an earlier point, these participants did not know the topic of the teaching session prior to their attendance, and their mean high rating is consistent with other studies. We have included this explicitly in the Results.

Discussion:

15. Overall the discussion provides a comprehensive and thoughtful discourse on interpreting the findings. However, the structure needs some clean-up. Discussions generally flow better for the reader when they follow the order of: summary of results, discussion of theoretical contributions, practical implications (if applicable), study limitations, and directions for future directions. Currently, the discussion jumps back and forth between these aspects and makes it somewhat difficult to follow. I strongly recommend providing the reader some structure to allow easier digestion of the discussion section by arranging the section into the order above.

- The current structure of the Discussion begins with a summary of results, (i) discussion of the results together with study limitations and (iii) directions for future research. We have clarified this with subheadings. We believe this is an appropriate structure given the findings, and that it is most useful to the reader to spend the majority of the Discussion considering how they came about. Second, given the nature of the findings, we must take care to contextualise theoretical contributions---hence the decision to include them within the more in-depth treatment of the findings.

- In response to comments from the first reviewer, we have included broader theoretical work in both the Introduction and Discussion, which should make the Discussion easier to follow.

16. Typo and missing phrasing on page 14: “(Vernon & Hocking, 2016) (though see .”

- This has been corrected.

Other:

17. The reference section should use hanging indents to comply with APA style.

- This has been corrected.

18. Overall, the entire manuscript is in need of a thorough read-through for grammar and clarity. Words are sometimes missing, misspelled, or awkward language is used. Also, be consistent in the use of hyphens – see the first full paragraph on page 4 regarding the use of “perspective-taking” versus “perspective taking”.

- The MS has been proofread again.
